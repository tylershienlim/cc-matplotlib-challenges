Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you'll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve."

    "1. Roller coasters are thrilling amusement park rides designed to make you squeal and scream! They take you up high, drop you to the ground quickly, and sometimes even spin you upside down before returning to a stop. Today you will be taking control back from the roller coasters and visualizing data covering international roller coaster rankings and roller coaster statistics.\n",

Rankings for the best wood and steel roller coasters from the 2013 to 2018 [Golden Ticket Awards](http://goldenticketawards.com) are provded in `'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Wood.csv'` and `'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Steel.csv'`, respectively.

    "9. `.scatter()` is another useful function in matplotlib that you might not have seen before. `.scatter()` produces a scatter plot, which is similar to `.plot()` in that it plots points on a figure. `.scatter()`, however, does not connect the points with a line. This allows you to analyze the relationship between two variables. Find [`.scatter()`'s documentation here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html).\n",

Visit [our forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/roller-coaster-challenge-project-python-pandas/462378) or the file **Roller Coaster_Solution.ipynb** to compare your project to our sample solution code. You can also learn how to host your own solution on GitHub so you can share it with other learners! Your solution might look different from ours, and that's okay! There are multiple ways to solve these projects, and you'll learn more by seeing others' code."
